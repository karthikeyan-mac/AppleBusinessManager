# Apple Business and School Manager API

This script follows the **Implementing OAuth for the Apple School and Business Manager API** to generate client assertion and access token. 

You can refer to the official [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-school-and-business-manager-api/implementing-oauth-for-the-apple-school-and-business-manager-api) for further details on the OAuth implementation.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need to generate the following credentials from the Apple Business or School Manager portal:

- **PEM File**: An EC private key (.pem file) used for JWT signing.
- **Client ID** & **Team ID**: These can be the same for your account.
- **Key ID**: A unique identifier for the key used in the ABM/ASM portal.

For detailed instructions on how to generate these credentials, refer to the [Apple Support Guide for Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/apple-school-manager/axm33189f66a/1/web/1).

## Script Features

- **OAuth Authentication**: Uses JWT-based authentication to interact securely with the Apple API.
- **Device Information Retrieval**: Queries the assigned server for each device using device IDs.
- **CSV Output**: The fetched data is saved to a CSV file, including device ID, server name, server type, and timestamps.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Generate Credentials**:
   - Log in to the **Apple Business Manager** or **Apple School Manager** portal.
   - Follow the instructions in the [OAuth implementation guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-school-and-business-manager-api/implementing-oauth-for-the-apple-school-and-business-manager-api) to create your **PEM file**, **Client ID**, **Team ID**, and **Key ID**.

### 2. **Prepare Device List**:
   - Create **Text file** containing a list of device IDs to query.

### 3. **Configure the Script**:
   - Place your **private key file** (`cert.pem`) in the same directory as the script.
   - The **client assertion file** (`client_assertion.json`) will be auto-generated by the script if it doesnâ€™t exist.

### 4. **Install Python Dependencies**:
Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ installed, and install the required dependencies by running:
* requests
* authlib
* pycryptodome
